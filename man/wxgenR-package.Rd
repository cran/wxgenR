\title{wxgenR: A Stochastic Weather Generator with Seasonality}
\description{
A weather generator to simulate precipitation and temperature for regions with seasonality. Users input training data containing precipitation, temperature, and seasonality (up to 26 seasons). Including weather season as a training variable allows users to explore the effects of potential changes in season duration as well as average start- and end-time dates due to phenomena like climate change. Data for training should be a single time series but can originate from station data, basin averages, grid cells, etc. Bearup, L., Gangopadhyay, S., & Mikkelson, K. (2021).
